# Implementation of a Linked List ADT

In this code I have implemeted the Linked List Abstract Data Type with the help of which we can access a few basic commands of a linked list.

They include:

1.  Inserting a Node into the front of the List.
2.  Inserting a Node at any given position.
3.  Appending a Node to the end of the List.
4.  Sorting the Linked List.
5.  Check if the List exists.
6.  Display the Linked List
7.  Merge any 2 Linked List and return a sorted List.
8.  Deleting an element of the List given the Position of the Element.
9.  Deleting an element of the List given the Data Value.
